# Detecting Fake Accounts on Social Media

Nowadays, online social networks have changed the way we communicate. People are more likely to use the social network to keep in touch with family, friends and college. The massive growth of online social media creates a perfect environment for hackers. They use a fake account on the social media platform, such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram to gain access to personal data. The purpose of my research is to create an application that identifies if an account is fake or not and thus to protect people from fake accounts.

# Twittop is an online application that uses artificial intelligence to detect if a social media account is fake.
